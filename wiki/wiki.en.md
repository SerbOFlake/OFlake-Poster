# OFlake Poster

OFlake Poster is a tool for automating posting in Telegram. It allows you to send messages to Telegram channels based on templates using placeholders.

## Installation

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install python-telegram-bot
   ```

3. Download the OFlake Poster repository and unzip it. Or clone it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SerbOFlake/OFlake-Poster.git
   ```

## Configuration

### OOBE (Out-Of-Box Experience)

For the lazy, an OOBE tool has been assembled. Run it using:

```bash
python oobe.py
```

First, you will be prompted to enter the bot token:

Next, you need to enter the channel name:

> [!WARNING]
> Not the ID (will be prompted later)
> Here, enter the channel name to add to the configuration, i.e., simple names without spaces are preferable.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dac05e5-28f0-42a6-b54f-893e19227178)

Now, you need to get the channel ID. You can use:

1. Modded Telegram clients on Android (e.g., AyuGram initially displays the channel IDs).
2. Using the web version:
   - The web version URL contains the channel ID. Go to the channel and find this value (It is different for everyone).
   - ![Untitled](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af928d72-c6ad-4c82-8d76-9430413661c0)
   - The value should be negative for input.

Then enter the value here:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86e8a690-a76e-4a28-9398-10a093ae9ae6)

Done! You will see this again:

If you need to add more channels, enter them. If not, leave the line empty and press Enter:

> [!TIP]
> OOBE is completed, well done!

### Manual Configuration

Create a `config.ini` file in the application's root folder and insert the following content:

```ini
[secure]
token = Here you tokenff
oobe = false

[channels]
test = -1002271321808
```

- `token` â€” replace with your bot token.
- `oobe` â€” set to `true` if you want to run OOBE again.
- In `[channels]`, add your channels.

## Creating Templates (sample)

Go to the `samples` folder and create a file `test.txt`. Add the following content:

```
Example
Dynamic text: {$dyntext}

ðŸ‘» By : https://github.com/SerbOFlake/OFlake-Poster
```

Everything in `{$}` is a placeholder (also known as a filler). Save the file.

## Using the Poster

### Automation

Imagine a situation: you are a very sociable person and want a message in your group of like-minded people every time you use the `make` command.

Create a `makefile`:

```makefile
# Variables
CHANNEL = test
PLACEHOLDER = "I compiled something"
TEMPLATE = test.txt

# Target for sending a message
post:
	@echo "Sending a message to channel $(CHANNEL)..."
	@python cli.poster.py --channel $(CHANNEL) --sample $(TEMPLATE) \
		+dyntext "$(PLACEHOLDER)" \
	@echo "Message sent!"

# Target for cleaning (if necessary)
clean:
	@echo "Cleaning..."

# Default target
.PHONY: post clean
```

Now, when you run `make post`, a message will be sent to your channel about something being compiled.

### Manual Input

Run the poster:

```bash
python poster.py
```

You will see:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07f34d76-f04f-4a50-acf2-b69e05277a0a)

Here, enter your channel name (Name, not ID):

> [!NOTE]
> The name we set in the configuration.

Now, we need to specify the template (sample):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9435c72e-4ad0-41a0-b9a4-a6a6c46dc58b)

In our case, `test.txt`.

You will see the following lines:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748f7a15-f656-4752-a6fa-d91294d73a76)

Up to `ðŸªµ Available placeholders: dyntext` is the template content for understanding where everything is. In `ðŸªµ Available placeholders: dyntext`, you will see the placeholders available.

In:

```
ðŸªµ Enter placeholder: dyntext
ðŸªµ Enter content:
```

You will be prompted to enter content for each placeholder. For line breaks, use `\n`.

Enter something like:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fd1864f-329b-4ea7-acb1-422b6e92f78e)

The console output will be:

![sss](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81f2ccfe-ecf5-4d9e-8255-4e7199fafcb6)

And in the channel, it will be:
